As I don’t find the correlation I am doing this way with no of customer id more than 10
To get the count of relevant customers and its country name
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 10
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
| Customer_id | Country |
17                     Usa
14                     France
14                     Brazil
