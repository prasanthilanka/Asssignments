#Answers
I have gone through all the links.
Downloaded the sakila database on my laptop and moreover there is nothing to write about how I download the database because it’s a basic thing to do.
After downloading I used below command lines to install it.

mysql> SOURCE C:/Users/prasanthi/Downloads/Compressed/sakila-db/sakila-schema.sql;

and 

mysql> SOURCE C:/Users/prasanthi/Downloads/Compressed/sakila-db/sakila-data.sql;
